# Hello-world

Hi Guys!

From now on, sometimes I will enter this GitHub site and see other developer's code and study.
I used Python, C++ in Visual Studio. My track is Data-Science in SoftwareConvergence.

I haven't decided which area I want to make sure yet. 
I will continue to use Github to search for information, study and set the direction.
