# Hello-world

Hi Guys!

I'm Student of SoftwareConvergence in KyeongHee University.
From now on, sometimes I will enter this GitHub site and see other developer's code and study.
My track is Data-Science in SoftwareConvergence.

I used Python, C++ in Visual Studio.(But, I think there are still many parts that are not enough.)

I haven't decided which area I want to make sure yet. 
I will continue to use Github to search for information, study and set the direction.
